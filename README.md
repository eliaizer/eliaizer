# Hi, I’m @eliaizer

I'm more into backend or logical questions and building a system. I can do frontend, but I'm lazy. There's too much typing. There's a lot planned (maybe even too much).

## 🧠 About me
- 🎓 University: PGUPS named after Alexander I
- 💼 Status: studying and trying to find a job in my field (for now I work at a warehouse)
- 🛠 Preference: interesting projects, new tasks, elegant engineering solutions, a good and supportive team, life by the sea 🏖️
- 📍 Location: Saint Petersburg (UTC+3) ~~(52 bro)~~
- ⚡ Fun fact: when I started learning programming, I wrote in a form that I knew the programming language HTML (I still cringe)
- 💯 Just a fact: I am lazy
